### About the Lab

The Faltas Lab focuses on studying bladder cancer as a model disease for dissecting the fundamental biological mechanisms that drive the evolution of human cancers. We are investigating the role of the APOBEC3 mutagenic enzymes which edit the genome of cancer cells. We use a broad range of experimental tools and models to understand their role in cancer evolution. Our work aims to improve the lives of bladder cancer patients by translating our discoveries to early-phase and first-in-human clinical trials.
